# Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses physical flower measurements to classify Iris species using two popular supervised algorithms: **Decision Tree** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal dimensions.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end ML workflow:

* Loading and exploring data
* Preprocessing and scaling features
* Training multiple classifiers
* Comparing model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices

---

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source:** Classic Iris Dataset (`sklearn.datasets.load_iris`)
* **Features:**
* Sepal length (cm)
* Sepal width (cm)
* Petal length (cm)
* Petal width (cm)


* **Target Classes:**
* `0` — *Iris-setosa*
* `1` — *Iris-versicolor*
* `2` — *Iris-virginica*

## 🛠️ Setup & Execution Instructions

To run this project locally or in Google Colab:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

```

### Running in Google Colab / Jupyter

1. Download the `.ipynb` file from this repository.
2. Upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or open it locally with Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom.

## 📈 Results & Evaluation

Both models were trained using an 80/20 train-test split:

| Model | Accuracy Score |
| --- | --- |
| **Decision Tree** | ~96.7% – 100% |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | ~96.7% – 100% |

### Key Findings

* **Iris-setosa** was perfectly separated by both algorithms due to distinct feature ranges.
* Minor overlap occasionally occurs between **Versicolor** and **Virginica**, depending on the test split.

## 💡 Conclusion & Key Learnings

* **Feature Scaling:** Essential for distance-based algorithms like KNN to prevent larger numeric ranges from dominating predictions.
* **Model Selection:** Decision Trees provide quick interpretability through decision boundaries, while KNN relies on proximity in feature space. Both are highly effective for clean, low-dimensional tabular datasets.
